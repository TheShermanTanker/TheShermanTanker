### TheShermanTanker

Welcome to my humble abode, in here is an archive of all the development work I do on a day to day basis, both official or out of interest.

I'm a very avid Java developer, it being the first language I started my journey as a developer in. I also am experienced with other languages in varying degrees,
such as: C, C++, C#, PHP, Python and Javascript. One of my greatest interests is in the area of language implementations, and I have written code that is now
[part of the official Python Interpreter](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/95897),
and the official Java Virtual Machine (see below), both of which run the Python and Java programming languages, respectively.

I work quite a bit in open source development, that said, it's typically the same few codebases, which I'll mention below.

### Java

I am a voluntary committer at OpenJDK, which manages development of the official
[Java Development Kit](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk)
and many related projects, used worldwide by devices to run applications written in the
[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
programming language. I'm an Author of this Group, making me responsible for submitting improvements and bugfixes.

I'm also a Committer specifically for the Java Development Kit mentioned above, _the_ official Java implementation that the entire world depends on to run the Java
programming language, or applications that depend on it. Here I mostly work as a build systems developer, where I clean up, improve, and enhance the make system
used to compile the Java Virtual Machine, its native and Java written libraries, and the corresponding launchers and tools. Other times, I also get the privilege
of working on the Java Virtual Machine itself (named HotSpot), and also help out cleaning up code in other places of the codebase whenever I can. You can see my
in progress work on the JDK
[here](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pulls/TheShermanTanker)
and all my accepted and integrated enhancements or fixes
[here](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ATheShermanTanker+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aintegrated).

My biggest ongoing work with the JDK so far is enhancing it's code to be compiler agnostic, as well as implementing the ability hopefully plug and compile with any
C or C++ compiler. In particular, I am the Author of
[8288293: Decouple compiler from OS](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8288293),
and you can see all the related work I've managed to complete so far over there on the OpenJDK tracker.

When I'm not actively doing development work, I'm discussing changes to make the Java language better with other people who work on it, or how to make HotSpot even
faster than it already is. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to work on
[Leyden](https://github.com/openjdk/leyden)
and other interesting projects under OpenJDK in the future.

### Skara

Aside from the Java Development Kit itself, I also work on other OpenJDK tools and utilities, such as
[Skara](https://github.com/openjdk/skara),
the tool used to integrate changes developers make into any OpenJDK codebases. I do have a certain
[big enhancement I want to implement](https://github.com/openjdk/skara/pull/1409)
for Skara, I currently am stalled on doing so since GitHub refuses to implement an API feature that allows me to do so :(

### Eclipse

I'm also a Contributor for the Eclipse Foundation, where I work on helping to improve the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment, which is my favourite code
editor by far. I've only had
[one small contribution so far](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt/pull/225),
but I am also working on a very big enhancement for Eclipse CDT, where I plan on
[implementing a new language backend for C and C++, excluding all GNU Extensions](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt/pull/184).

### PaperMC

I've worked extensively on a fork of the PaperMC Minecraft Server, though I have not contributed much to the organization itself. I do, however, maintain my own
custom fork of their
[Paperweight build tool](https://github.com/TheShermanTanker/paperweight),
which is required for working on and compiling the Paper Minecraft Server, as well as a custom fork of the Server code itself.

### About Me

Aside from being a developer, I also have very strange hobbies and interests. I'm incredibly passionate about several aspects of Biology, and the possibly limitless
potential all of us have deep in our flesh. I'm fascinated about how we could tap into this through the science of Genetics, for our own betterment. I'm also very
intrigued by the fabric of reality, which has led me down several rabbit holes into Special and General Relativity, as well as Quantum Mechanics. I also like to
link these topics to my love for Biology, through the field of Quantum Biology.

When I'm not working on the official codebases mentioned above, I'm usually playing Minecraft, which remains my favourite game to this day, as well as other games,
such as Dying Light, Generation Zero, Ace Attorney, or Team Fortress 2. While I'm a gamer, I also have a rather bad habit of modifying the code of the games I play
when I don't like the mechanics in the base game. Several of the decompiled games I play can be found in my list of
[repositories](https://github.com/TheShermanTanker?tab=repositories).
